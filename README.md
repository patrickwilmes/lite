# sevDesk Lite
sevDesk Lite will be the best tool on the market to easily create invoices and showcase your skills as a developer.
We provided you a  basic application that acts as a starter kit. But there is still work to be done to make it better!

### Setup
- Clone and checkout the main repository: https://gitlab.com/sevdesk/recruting_case.git

### Next steps

1. **"Lay of the land"**
    - Get yourself acquainted with the existing codebase. What does it do already? How are these features implemented? Is there an underlying structure?.
    - This overview will help you in the following exercises, but you should also be able to give a quick rundown for us during our team interview.
2. **"Choose your own adventure"**
    - We have provided you a collection of tasks (see `./lite-ui/Readme.md` for Frontend or `./lite/Readme.md` for Backend) that can be performed on the project.
    - The tasks vary in complexity, size and overall effort to complete.
    - Types of tasks include: Bugfixes, feature implementations, testing, refactorings, pull request reviews, system design evaluation.
    - `!important`: You don't need to complete all tasks. Do a few and do them well.
    - Pick and choose the tasks that fit your current skill level and the abilities you want to showcase
    - Keep in mind the timeframe we have provided you to work on the exercises and make your choice accordingly
    - If at the end you have a little time left that would not be sufficient to implement a task, you can also prepare some notes instead that walk us through your thought process of implementation.
3. **"Everything is connected"**
    - Frontend and backend are connected and should be able to talk to each other if you start both
    - The UI runs on http://localhost:5173 backend listens to http://localhost:8081
    - If you want you can also separate both again. The Backend runs independently of the UI, for the UI you will have to mock the Backend since it will push and pull data from the Database.
